# libfuzzer-bot

Fuzzing bots for opensource projects
------------------------------------
Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product.

The goal of this project is to set up and maintain several
public fuzzing bots that will use
[libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html),
[AddressSanitizer](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html),
and other tools to automatically find bugs.

See subdirs for project-specific files and docs:
